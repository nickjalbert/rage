To compile in scratchbox, you need to install libqt4-dev=4.5.3~git20090723-0maemo6+0m5, as well
as all dependencies (like core, gui, network, etc).  It's because scratchbox has Qt 4.6.2,
while the N900s currently only use 4.5.3.  

Once you have the dev packages installed: qmake, then make.  qmake builds the Makefile.

The UI file was made with QtDesigner (called designer from the command line, on most systems
with the dev packages install (I think)).
